## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  vars:
    logrotate_frequency: daily
    logrotate_keep: 7
    logrotate_compress: yes
    logrotate_user: root
    logrotate_group: syslog
    logrotate_entries:
      - name: example
        path: "/var/log/example/*.log"
      - name: example-frequency
        path: "/var/log/example-frequency/*.log"
        frequency: weekly
      - name: example-keep
        path: "/var/log/example-keep/*.log"
        keep: 14
      - name: example-compress-yes
        path: "/var/log/example-compress/*.log"
        compress: yes
      - name: example-compress-no
        path: "/var/log/example-compress/*.log"
        compress: no

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.logrotate
```

The machine needs to be prepared in CI this is done using `molecule/resources/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.cron
```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for logrotate

# How often to rotate logs, either daily, weekly or monthly.
logrotate_frequency: weekly

# How many files to keep.
logrotate_keep: 4

# Should rotated logs be compressed??
logrotate_compress: yes

# User/Group for rotated log files
logrotate_user: root
logrotate_group: syslog
```

## [Testing](#testing)

[Unit tests](https://travis-ci.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-logrotate) are done on every commit, pull request, release and periodically.

If you find issues, please register them in [GitHub](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-logrotate/issues)

Testing is done using [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule):

[Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tests multiple ansible versions.
[Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule) tests multiple distributions.

To test using the defaults (any installed ansible version, namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`):

```
molecule test

# Or select a specific image:
image=ubuntu molecule test
# Or select a specific image and a specific tag:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```

Or you can test multiple versions of Ansible, and select images:
Tox allows multiple versions of Ansible to be tested. To run the default (namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`) tests:

```
tox

# To run CentOS (namespace: `robertdebock`, tag: `latest`)
image="centos" tox
# Or customize more:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```
